## HW1
### 1. Selection Sort
- Sorting a single linked list in ascending order swapping nodes.
- I made my own single linked list with 15 different integers nodes.
- This will show before & after swapping of the list.

### 2. Tertiary search
- Finding the index of a certain number in an array by splitting it in three ways with recursive method.
- If the number is not in the array, it will say "The number is not in this array."

## HW2
### Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Traverse BST with inorder method : 
  1. Traverse the left subtree
  2. Visit the root.
  3. Traverse the right subtree
- Delete '40'
- Delete '20'

## HW3
### 1. Read an Original Array

### 2. New Array Using Floyd's Algorithm
- Finding the shortest path between all the pairs of vertices in a weighted graph

### 3. Sort Array into Descending Order

## HW4
### 1. Depth First Search (DFS) traversal
- Begins at the root node and proceeds through the nodes as far as possible until we reach the node with no unvisited nearby nodes

### 2. Breadth First Search (BFS) traversal 
- Walk through all nodes on the same level before moving on to the next level

## HW5
### 1. DFS & BFS topological sort for the 1st graph with 8 vertices
### 2. DFS & BFS topological sort for the 2nd graph with 14 vertices

## Programming Language
- C++
