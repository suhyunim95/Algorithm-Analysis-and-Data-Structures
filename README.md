## Selection Sort
- Sorting a single linked list in ascending order swapping nodes.
- I made my own single linked list with 15 different integers nodes.
- This will show before & after swapping of the list.

## Tertiary search
- Finding the index of a certain number in an array by splitting it in three ways with recursive method.
- If the number is not in the array, it will say "The number is not in this array."

## Programming Language
- C++
