## HW1
### Selection Sort
- Sorting a single linked list in ascending order swapping nodes.
- I made my own single linked list with 15 different integers nodes.
- This will show before & after swapping of the list.

### Tertiary search
- Finding the index of a certain number in an array by splitting it in three ways with recursive method.
- If the number is not in the array, it will say "The number is not in this array."

## HW2
### Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Traverse BST with inorder method : 
  1. Traverse the left subtree
  2. Visit the root.
  3. Traverse the right subtree
- Delete '40'
- Delete '20'

## Programming Language
